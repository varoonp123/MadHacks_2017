chromosomes:
fire rate:
aggression
health
speed
likelihood to dodge
shot speed
num_enemies
curvature
spawn new enemies

Objective Function: f(Time Survived, health taken off player, recip of change in player score?) 


Patterns:
dodge and get shot
circle
Move in square
follow player
total random motion (pick random points)


Tasks 
	~Define permutations of chromosomes
	implement different strategies
	~implement evol algorithm (inspyred)	
	~Determine objective/fitness function
	Implement multiprocessing - EXAMPLE DONE


ENEMY_VECTOR: [fire_rate, speed]
